# RandomPokemonTeam
A program that allows you to create randomized Pokemon Teams from the regions of your choice for you and your friends.

# How it works
* The user inputs the number of people in the group that will be generated a team.
* The user selects a region. Then, the program grabs a random Pokemon from the region.
* There will be 6 rounds - one for each Pokemon in each team's party.
* There will be presets for people to choose from where one can change whether or not the team can contain too many of one type, whether a team can contain legendaries, etc. Hopefully this will allow different types of playthroughs for all types of players.
